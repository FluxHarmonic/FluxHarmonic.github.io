#+date: [2022-01-20]
#+slug: 2022-01-20

*Today's goal:* wire up the scripting language enough to get our circles rendering again!

* Updates

Starting next week, the Tuesday / Thursday streams will start at *3PM UTC* and run for *2 hours* each!

I'm still experimenting with how to make the streams and channel more interesting and sustainable.  I'd love to hear your feedback!

* Tasks

** TODO Simplify finding keyword name/value pairs in function calls
** TODO Finish porting previous Guile interface code over to the new language
** TODO Finish writing the =render-to-file= function
** TODO Get back to the tasks from the previous streams!

* Notes

Code for this stream is here:

* Next Steps
