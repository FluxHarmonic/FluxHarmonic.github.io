* The Plan

The overall goal of this channel is to create an audiovisual playground that I use to create music, videos, graphics, and even games live on stream!

All tools will be purpose-built for myself.  I don't intend for others to use my tools at first, but over time I might be able to add a level of polish that would enable others to use them.

** Audio Tools

- Synthesizers of various types (additive, subtractive, FM, wavetable, sampler)
- Effects processors of various types (compressor, limiter, noise gate, reverb, chorus, flanger, etc)
- Custom music creation environment on Linux powered by JACK or Pipewire (DAW)

** Visual Tools

- Custom video creation and editing environment
- Visual effects processors of various types
- Audio visualizations of various types
- Motion graphics tools for video animations and still graphics (video thumbnails, etc)
- Whiteboard tool for drawing diagrams live in streams (and possibly for videos)

** Programming

- Low-level custom C libraries (the core of all tools will be written in C!)
- Custom programming tools for quick live programming of native applications and audio plugins
- Custom Scheme-inspired scripting language that powers the various tools and serves as an authoring and data format

** Streaming

- Custom live streaming software that integrates the various tools I make
- Live-rendered scenes, video filters, generated graphics, viewer-interactable components, etc

* Why?

I enjoy programming for the creative value and to see what I can accomplish.

- Create background music and graphics for my YouTube channels
- Produce a full album of music created with my own tools
- Design a really unique streaming experience
- Create Free Software games

I want to do all this while making the experience of watching it fun and interesting!

All of this won't be achievable in the short term: I see it as a long-term adventure in creativity.

* The Design

To accomplish all of this, I've got a specific design in mind:

- Write all multimedia components in C (or similar low-level language)
- Use Guile Scheme as the interactivity layer (at first)
- Create an Emacs package to facilitate interactivity and rapid development
- Use GNU Guix as the orchestrator for development, distribute tools via a channel
- Be pragmatic, but ultimately write things as "from scratch" as I can!

The source to everything will be available as I write it, most likely licensed as GPL 3.0.

* The Starting Point

- Get the basic infrastructure set up for the C core with the Guile Scheme layer
- Set up a SDL window to start experimenting with graphics (later write our own graphics layer)
- Start building a graphics tool to make video thumbnails and stream graphics

* Tasks

Here's what I'd like to accomplish today:

** DONE Create a basic C application that loads Guile Scheme engine
CLOSED: [2021-12-28 Tue 16:06]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2021-12-28 Tue 16:06]
:END:
** DONE Start a REPL and get it loading inside of Emacs
CLOSED: [2021-12-28 Tue 16:46]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2021-12-28 Tue 16:46]
:END:
** DONE Start building the "language" for describing graphics scenes
CLOSED: [2021-12-28 Tue 17:59]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2021-12-28 Tue 17:59]
:END:
** DONE Set up SDL so that we can start drawing things to the screen
CLOSED: [2021-12-28 Tue 17:59]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2021-12-28 Tue 17:59]
:END:
** DONE Figure out how to use =guix shell= to create a reproducible dev environment
CLOSED: [2021-12-28 Tue 17:59]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2021-12-28 Tue 17:59]
:END:
** TODO Get something rendering on the screen!
** TODO Push the initial code to GitHub

* Next Steps

** TODO Don't show Guile Scheme banner when starting =flux-studio=
** TODO Figure out why =init-graphics= can't be accessed in =flux graphics= module
** TODO Figure out why =init-graphics= is crashing the process, can we come up with a good debugging strategy (running via gdb)
** TODO Get something rendering on the screen!
