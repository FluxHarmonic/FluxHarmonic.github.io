*Today's goal:* Continue hacking on our Ludum Dare 50 entry to turn it into a complete game!

[[yt:WMwQMml2wb8][Watch the recording on YouTube!]]

* Updates

- Had a great time streaming during Ludum Dare 50!
- Code can be found at: https://github.com/FluxHarmonic/ld50-silent-syphon
- "Silent Sypher" entry: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/$278582

*Mesche progress:*

- Fixed a couple of nasty issues I found during the game competition:
  - Crashes when the game ends due to a strange (yet simple) GC bug
  - Issue with =if= expressions in some functions, wasn't jumping correctly!
- Saving compiled bytecode to object files for the purpose of bundling with the executable

* The Plan

Ludum Dare was a lot of fun!  It's given me the motivation to polish this game to a completed state and "release" it by the end of the year.
