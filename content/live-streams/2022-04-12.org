* Updates

- Had a great time streaming during Ludum Dare 50!
- "Silent Sypher" entry: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/$278582

*Mesche progress:*

- Fixed a couple of nasty issues I found during the game competition:
  - Crashes when the game ends due to a strange (yet simple) GC bug
  - Issue with =if= expressions in some functions, wasn't jumping correctly!
- Saving compiled bytecode to object files for the purpose of bundling with the executable

* The Plan

Ludum Dare was a lot of fun!  It's given me the motivation to polish this game to a completed state and "release" it by the end of the year.



** High Level Tasks

*** TODO Polish up the main menu
*** TODO Add a few more types of enemies
*** TODO Add powerups that are dropped randomly
*** TODO More weapons for the player?
*** TODO Starfield display in the background
*** TODO Create sprite graphics for everything and polish them over time

* Tasks

** TODO Fork the =ld50-silent-sypher= code to a new repository
** TODO Move task list from previous slide to a file in the game repo
** TODO Take a look at the current state of the game
