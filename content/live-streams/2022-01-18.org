#+title: Wiring Up the Scripting Language
#+date: [2022-01-18]
#+slug: 2022-01-18

* Updates

I took some time to squash some bugs and clean up some of the scripting language code since last stream!

We're now in a solid place to start from today.

** Offline Tasks

*** Use gdb watch to figure out why token kinds are being overwritten
*** Clean up some of the repeated patterns in the code
*** Fix issue with setting integer values
*** Verify that call expression eval from last time works after fixes
*** Write =flux_vector= library and move tokenizer code over to it

* Some Thoughts on C

After dabbling with C on and off over the last couple of years and then spending a lot more time learning and using it recently, I've had the following thoughts:

- Immense power that requires good practices and tools
- It seems possible to design decent abstractions
- Possibly the most portable and transferrable language
- A fantastic basis for building your own platform or "universe"
- It does more than you think it does, but with the right balance of abstraction
- I /really/ want to master this language

* Notes

Code for this stream is here:

* Next Steps

** TODO Simplify finding keyword name/value pairs in function calls
** TODO Finish porting previous Guile interface code over to the new language
** TODO Finish writing the =render-to-file= function
** TODO Get back to the tasks from the previous streams!
