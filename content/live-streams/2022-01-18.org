* Updates

I took some time to squash some bugs and clean up some of the scripting language code since last stream!

We're now in a solid place to start from today.

* Some Thoughts on C

After dabbling with C on and off over the last couple of years and then spending a lot more time learning and using it recently, I've had the following thoughts:

- Immense power that requires good practices and tools
- It seems possible to design decent abstractions
- Possibly the most portable and transferrable language
- A fantastic basis for building your own platform or "universe"
- It does more than you think it does, but with the right balance of abstraction
- I /really/ want to master this language

* Next Steps

** TODO Evaluate call expressions
** TODO Port previous Guile interface code over to the new language
** TODO Finish writing the =render-to-file= function
** TODO Add a basic REPL interface for live evaluation
** TODO Hook up the REPL to Emacs
** TODO Get back to the tasks from the previous streams!
