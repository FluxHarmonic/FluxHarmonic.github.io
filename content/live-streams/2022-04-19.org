* Finishing the Pickup Design

Last stream we successfully implemented one important part of pickup objects: the application of "effects" when they are applied.

We also started writing the logic for displaying a pickup in the game world but we now need to finish collision detection so that the player can pick them up when touched!

* Tasks

** TODO Finish collision detection for pickups
** TODO Make sure that "effects" are applied correctly
** TODO Add a few pickup effects based on the ideas we discussed on the last stream
** TODO Add random pickup drops when killing enemies (maybe indicate when an enemy has one?)
** TODO Destroy pickups when they're shot by the player? (or enemies?)
