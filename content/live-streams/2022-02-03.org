#+title: I Rewrote The Graphics Layer...
#+date: [2022-02-03]
#+slug: 2022-02-03

*Today's goal:* Finish our initial implementation of TrueType font rendering!

* Updates

- Join the Discord for Flux Harmonic: https://discord.gg/ryy97Rdw
- I rewrote the graphics layer

* So about those OpenGL APIs...

[A story about my realization and rewrite journey]

*Benefits*

- Potential for much better rendering performance
- Can more efficiently pass our data structures directly to OpenGL
- Shaders give us *many* possibilities for rendering effects

* Tasks

** TODO Rewrite glyph renderer using new OpenGL APIs and a shader
** TODO Implement proper glyph alignment
** TODO Maybe add a nice gradient to rendered text?
** TODO Use FontConfig to find the font by name

* Notes

The code for this stream can be found here:

* Next Steps

** TODO Render all glyphs to a single texture atlas for performance
** TODO Possibly "bake" a texture for static strings to reduce draw calls
