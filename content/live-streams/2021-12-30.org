* Graphics Layer Design

Let's continue with the idea we came up with last time to see how far we can take it:

- Use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode][retained mode]] rendering model
- Describe the graphics to be rendered in the Scheme layer
- The C layer will interpret and render the complete scene or instruction list efficiently
- The Scheme layer can replace the graphics instructions at any time (REPL-based "drawing")
- Animations will eventually be possible by describing changes to elements in the scene over time

The goal today is to get some basic things rendering in a preview window and /possibly/ save it out to a .png file.

* Tasks

Here's what I'd like to accomplish today:

** TODO Rename the project to =flux-compose=
** TODO Figure out why =init-graphics= can't be accessed in =flux graphics= module
** TODO Figure out why =init-graphics= is crashing the process, can we come up with a good debugging strategy (running via gdb)
** TODO Get something rendering on the screen!
** TODO Transmit drawing instructions to renderer thread in some form
** TODO Get the =basic-gfx.scm= example working
** TODO Render the completed image to a .png file

* Notes

* Next Steps
