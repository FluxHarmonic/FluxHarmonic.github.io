#+title: How Hard Can Text Rendering Really Be?
#+date: [2022-02-01]
#+slug: 2022-02-01

*Today's goal:* Lay the groundwork for TrueType font rendering!

* Updates

- Created a Discord for Flux Harmonic: https://discord.gg/ryy97Rdw
- PNG saving now works (Thanks to =libspng='s author Randy for stopping by!)
- I added some code for rotating and scaling rendered textures
- Also made the preview area center itself and be scalable

* Rendering TrueType fonts with OpenGL

Today we'll be using the long-lived FreeType library to load up a TrueType font so that we can extract glyphs for each letter, turn them into OpenGL textures, and render them to the screen.

Things we'll probably have to deal with:

- Storing information about characters of different sizes
- Kerning, to a basic degree (the space between characters)
- Locating fonts by name using FontConfig (probably later)

We won't be adding things like text wrapping or alignment (yet), this code will just render a string from left to right.

* Next Steps


** TODO Find out how to make the text white instead of red!
** TODO Improve the kerning of the text (or make it configurable)
** TODO Maybe add a nice gradient to rendered text?
** TODO Render all glyphs to a single texture atlas for performance
** TODO Possibly "bake" a texture for static strings to reduce draw calls
