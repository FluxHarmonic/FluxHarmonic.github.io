* Updates

- Recieved a few issues and pull requests, thanks Christian and Felipe!
- Improved the README with basic hacking instructions
- Moved =lib= code, improved =Makefiles=
- Considered Zig this weekend, will stick with C for now

* Encoding C structs from Scheme

- Structs are laid out contiguously
- Do we need to worry about memory alignment?
- What about nested data?

* Tasks

** TODO Try to finish instantiating a test scene in C (try Felipe's fix)
** TODO Figure out how to create the C struct representation for scene objects in Scheme
** TODO Transmit drawing instructions to renderer thread in some form (SDL event?)
** TODO Get the =basic-gfx.scm= example working
** TODO Make sure that we can re-eval the Scheme code to update the live preview
** TODO Render the completed image to a .png file
** TODO Load and render an image file
