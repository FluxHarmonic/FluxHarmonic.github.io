#+title: Encoding the Scene
#+date: [2022-01-04]
#+slug: 2022-01-04

* Updates

- Recieved a few issues and pull requests, thanks Christian and Felipe!
- Improved the README with basic hacking instructions
- Moved =lib= code, improved =Makefiles=
- Considered Zig this weekend, will stick with C for now
- Didn't get the summary video out this week!

* Encoding C structs from Scheme

- Structs are laid out contiguously
- Do we need to worry about memory alignment?
- What about nested data?

* Tasks
