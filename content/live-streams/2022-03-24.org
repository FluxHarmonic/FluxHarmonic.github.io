#+title: Automatic Game Publishing on Itch.io
#+date: [2022-03-24]
#+slug: 2022-03-24

*Today's goal:* Automatically publish new builds of Crash The Stack on Itch.io every time a commit is pushed to the repo!

* Updates

- Finished the first pass of =mesche build= design, updated all projects to use it
- Added new functionality for =mesche process=
- Added new =mesche io= module
- Started working on porting Mesche to Windows

* Automating Game Publishing

Today we're going to try to automate the publishing of our game project Crash The Stack on Itch.io using GitHub Actions and =mesche build=.

Itch.io has a command line tool called Butler which makes this fairly easy: https://itch.io/docs/butler/

Here's the Itch.io page for the project: https://fluxharmonic.itch.io/crash-the-stack

The current builds there are old from the previous incarnation of the project!
