#+title: Improving the Graphics Layer

#+slug: 2022-01-25

*Today's goal:* Switch from SDL2 to GLFW and get something rendering!

* Updates

- Special thanks to *Felipe Balbi* for spending a lot of time improving the quality of the code and build!

* Switching to GLFW

Today we're going to spend some time moving the graphics layer from SDL2 to GLFW.

*Benefits*

- Direct access to OpenGL rendering APIs without bringing in everything else SDL2 offers
- No unnecessary code for playing sounds and other game-specific functionality
- We can write our own APIs that wrap what GLFW and OpenGL

At some point we might even get rid of GLFW, but we'll stick with this path for a while :)

* Tasks

** TODO Figure out a good pattern for starting the render/event loop
** TODO Add SIGTERM handler for cleaning up graphics resources
** TODO Add basic event loop
** TODO Add screen clearing function
** TODO Add rect rendering function
