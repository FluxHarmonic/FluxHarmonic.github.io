#+title: Creating Our First Image
#+date: [2022-01-06]
#+slug: 2022-01-06

Today's goal: create a basic image and render it to a PNG file!

* Updates

- Thanks to Ashraz, we now have lsp-mode (and eglot) working for the C code!
- Project Makefiles are now generated by CMake
- The generated =compile_commands.json= feeds =ccls= information about where project dependencies are

* Looking Ahead

- I /really/ want to abandon SDL2 as soon as I can
- My goal is to use GLFW to set up rendering context, event loop, and input
- Write my own rendering layer with OpenGL and shaders
- The plan: get some things working in SDL2 to validate the model, then drop it

* Tasks

** TODO Figure out why scene flipping doesn't work (event problem?)
** TODO Flesh out the approach for calling C functions to communicate scene data
** TODO Make sure that we can re-eval the Scheme code to update the live preview
** TODO Write a function that can convert HTML-style hex colors to RGBA
** TODO Render the image to a .png file
** TODO Load and render an image file
** TODO Figure out how to render basic text on the image

* Notes

* Next Steps
