#+title: Hardcoding our First Video Thumbnail
#+date: [2022-02-08]
#+slug: 2022-02-08

*Today's goal:* Produce our first real thumbnail by replicating the one for today's stream!

* Updates

- Thanks to Garjola for pointing out a bug that affected font rendering!
- I expanded the Fontconfig code slightly
- I've been rewriting the scripting language...

* Producing a Real Thumbnail (Finally!)

We now have enough functionality to produce basic, usable thumbnails!

- Loading and saving PNG files
- Rendering image textures
- Rendering text
- Fragment shader support

Today we'll use these features to hardcode a replication of the thumbnail I created for today's stream!

Once we've got this working, I'll start using this code to produce the thumbnail for all future Flux Harmonic streams.

* Tasks

** DONE Move existing test render code into its own function

** TODO Fix image renderer to create the correct size of image with appropriate output
** TODO Write a function to measure the pixel width of a string rendered with a specific font to use in screen centering
** TODO Expand the font fragment shader to add a configurable drop shadow to text

* Notes

The code for this stream can be found here:

* Next Steps

** TODO Fix basic positioning of textures on screen
** TODO Fix color blending of fill rects (Emile's gamma fix)
** TODO Fix image renderer to create the correct size of image with appropriate output
** TODO Write a function to measure the pixel width of a string rendered with a specific font to use in screen centering
** TODO Expand the font fragment shader to add a configurable drop shadow to text
