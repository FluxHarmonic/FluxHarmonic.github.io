#+title: Loading and Saving Images
#+date: [2022-01-27]
#+slug: 2022-01-27

*Today's goal:* Get an image rendering on screen and save the composition to a file!

* Updates

- I wired up =main.c= to load script files again!
- *Felipe* found a better way to store a handle to the =FluxWindow= with =GLFWwindow=

* Let's finally start handling images

We'll use the =libspng= library or =lodepng= to decode a PNG file into an OpenGL texture and then render it to the screen.

Once we get that working, we'll try to render the screen to a PNG file, possibly with optimizations.  This will be an important step toward creating thumbnails with =flux-compose=!

* Tasks

** TODO Add PNG loading
** TODO Render an image texture to the screen
** TODO See if we can render the OpenGL context back to a PNG
** TODO Automate the process of rendering an image file from the command line
