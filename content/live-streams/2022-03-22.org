#+slug: 2022-03-22

*Today's goal:* Implement basic game logic for board tile placement and matching!

[[yt:Hm9vwLWfFh4][Watch the recording on YouTube!]]

* Updates

- Overhauled the =mesche build= design to make it easier to manage
- Split out the substratic library into a separate repo: https://github.com/substratic/engine
- Added support for record field setters
- Added support for =:rest= arguments

* Let's add some game logic!

The rules for playable tiles are:

- One side on the horizontal axis must not be adjacent to another tile
- There must not be another tile directly on top of it (the layer above)

* Tasks

** DONE Get randomized tile face placement working
